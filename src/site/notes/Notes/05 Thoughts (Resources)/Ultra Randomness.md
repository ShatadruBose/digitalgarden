# **Ultra Randomness: A Novel System of Stochastic Evaluation**

**Author:** Shatadru Bose  
**Date:** May 9, 2025

## **Abstract**

This paper introduces _Ultra Randomness_, a unique stochastic framework developed for evaluating elements based on both their numerical balance and internal variability. Unlike conventional randomization techniques that focus solely on uniform or Gaussian distributions, Ultra Randomness employs a dual-random-point model within an assigned range per element. The system then derives a deterministic score reflecting the relative "random strength" of each element. This method can be applied in gamified selection mechanisms, algorithmic creativity engines, or decision-making models requiring chaotic fairness.

## **1. Introduction**

Randomness plays a vital role in computational systems, especially in simulations, cryptography, games, and probabilistic models. However, randomness is often treated as a black box—a uniform or weighted output from a fixed source. Ultra Randomness reimagines this paradigm by introducing structured chaos. This system generates a deterministic score for any element based on the random spread of two values within a custom range, balancing unpredictability and precision.

---

## **2. The Framework**

### **2.1 Input Specification**

Each element is assigned a custom **range**, defined as:

[lower limit,upper limit][\text{lower limit}, \text{upper limit}][lower limit,upper limit]

This range specifies the allowable span of randomness for that element. There is no constraint that all elements share the same range.

---

### **2.2 Random Point Selection**

Two random values, denoted as:

r1,r2∈[lower limit,upper limit]r_1, r_2 \in [\text{lower limit}, \text{upper limit}]r1​,r2​∈[lower limit,upper limit]

are selected from within the defined range for each element. These values are generated independently and uniformly.

---

### **2.3 Derived Parameters**

From the two selected values, the following are computed:

- **Spread (Δ)**:
    

Δ=∣r1−r2∣\Delta = |r_1 - r_2|Δ=∣r1​−r2​∣

- **Center (c)**:
    

c=r1+r22c = \frac{r_1 + r_2}{2}c=2r1​+r2​​

---

### **2.4 Winner Value (w)**

The core measure of Ultra Randomness is the _winner value_ or **w**, calculated as:

w=cΔw = \frac{c}{\Delta}w=Δc​

This formula ensures that higher center values and smaller spreads result in a stronger score, thereby favoring "balanced dominance." Notably, the division by spread causes extreme closeness between `r₁` and `r₂` to produce very large `w` values—creating spikes of high randomness in tightly paired ranges.

---

## **3. Decision Criterion**

The element with the **highest** value of `w` is declared the _winner_. This represents the most "ultra-random" element in the context of the current evaluation.

---

## **4. Interpretation and Behavior**

- A **larger center** suggests dominance within the range.
    
- A **smaller spread** indicates internal stability or "harmony."
    
- The **w value** combines both into a chaos-driven metric that rewards rare statistical coincidences (e.g., near-identical random points) with explosive scores.
    

This makes Ultra Randomness ideal for selection mechanisms where unpredictability and fairness need to _feel_ chaotic but be reproducible.

---

## **5. Example**

Assume two elements:

- Element A: Range [0.2, 0.6], → `r₁ = 0.45`, `r₂ = 0.40`
    
- Element B: Range [0.1, 0.9], → `r₁ = 0.78`, `r₂ = 0.32`
    

Calculations:

- **Element A**:
    
    - Δ = 0.05
        
    - c = 0.425
        
    - w = 0.425 / 0.05 = 8.5
        
- **Element B**:
    
    - Δ = 0.46
        
    - c = 0.55
        
    - w = 0.55 / 0.46 ≈ 1.196
        

**Winner:** Element A (w = 8.5)

---

## **6. Applications**

- Decision-making with a flair of chaos (e.g., choosing winners in simulations)
    
- Weighted element selection in games or stories
    
- Data synthesis where structured randomness is needed
    
- Creative AI systems involving novelty evaluation

## **7. Conclusion**

Ultra Randomness provides a structured way to evaluate chaotic systems by converting randomness into a deterministic score. Its design rewards both harmony and surprise—two essential traits for systems mimicking real-world unpredictability. This makes it a potent tool in any domain where randomness must be _felt_, not just calculated.
