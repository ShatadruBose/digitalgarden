### On Sunday.

#### Dream 1

I had a brother, who was stuck in a passport size photograph. Once my family forgot him and was heading towards the city, I told them that you have forgot my brother. They thanked me.

In the city was my father's office. My father took my brother and we went to our home. In the office, my father put my brother in a box and forgot him.

Me and my family want there and we were shocked. The photograph became distorted, was crying and sadly had passed away.
