### On Monday

#### Dream 1

I was with my friend going through over bridge to Barrackpore Railway Station. We were going towards a dry box. I put a cloth and it dried instantly. Then One of my uncle went from that road. Then, I accidently put my elbow in the box and I got hurt in the dream and there was a cut in the real life. After that we went home.
