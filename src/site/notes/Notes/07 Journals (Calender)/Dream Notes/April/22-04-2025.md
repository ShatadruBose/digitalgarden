### On Tuesday

#### Dream 1

I was going with my friend to find a person. We took a train that leads us to a colony where he leaves. First we visited one apartment. Then we went out and in the roads was the train line. We went to another and another. Then my friend told that there is a water bottle which is owned by that person only. I remembered that I saw that bottle in our first apartment. We went there and there indeed was the shop with the bottle we ask one person and she told that he was in the top. And we caught him.
